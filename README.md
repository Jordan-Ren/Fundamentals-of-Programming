# Fundamentals-of-Programming
These are all the labs I have completed during my freshman year. The details of each lab and a link to the lab are listed below:  
lab 1: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab1    
      This lab focused on modifying images. I was able to invert, blurr, and sharpen images, as well as detect edges within an image.
      A large portion of the lab focused on using kernels to modify images.  
lab 2: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab2  
      This lab tested our ability to use BFS. The premise of the lab was to find the shortest path between two actors that are in 
      some way related to each other given a JSON file that includes actors and the movies they aree associated with.   
lab 3: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab3  
      Here I created minesweeper, but with up to infinite dimentions.  
lab 4: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab4  
      The problem in thislab was to use recursive backtracking to fit shapes in a n x n grid given that there are spaces that 
      cannot be occupied. The main issue with this lab was time complexity.  
lab 5: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab5  
      Using a structure called a trie (explained in the link), I had to create functions that would auto complete, and auto
      correct a word or phrase given a large database of words and phrases.  
lab 6: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab6  
      This lab used a 'Graph' interface to conduct 'gift delivery' on behalf of santa (odd I know). But I essentialy had to create
      different graph classes that had the same structure as the 'Graph' interface, and create functions that do the same thing
      but each modified to fit the specific class.  
lab 7: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab7  
      Using the same structure as the last lab, we had to create more efficient gift deliveries given different structures of the 
      graphs such as star patterns and cliques, mainly focusing on speed.  
lab 8: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab8  
      Here I created a simple tower defense game involving feeding animals. I learned about serialization and deserialization as well
      as how timesteps work in real time games.   
lab 9: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab9  
      A continuation off lab 8, however we had to modify animal speeds, create new towers which changed based on timesteps and 
      animals fed, as well as create a special tower of out own (I created a sadistic zookeeper who threw bombs at animals that 
      exploded in a certain radius to remove animals).  
lab 10: https://6009.cat-soop.org/spring19/labs/lab10  
      This lab delt with downloading and caching files, I was able to make a skeleton gif run as well as a cat gif.
